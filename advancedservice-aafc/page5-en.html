<h2 id="a1.0">1.0 Purpose</h2>

 <p>The purpose of this guide is to provide you, the Applicant, with information about the Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiative. In addition, this guide will assist you in completing and applying for funding under this initiative.</p>
 
<h2 id="a2.0">2.0 Description of the Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiative</h2>

<p>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is one of several federal departments participating in the Youth Green Jobs Initiative. At AAFC, the Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiative is a part of the Government of Canada's Youth Employment Strategy (YES), to incent employment opportunities and attract youth to green jobs within the agriculture and agri-food sector.</p>

<p>There are two streams under this initiative:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet-none">
<li>Stream A – Green Farms: Farm operators could receive up to a maximum of $10,000 per intern to implement activities that are environmentally beneficial.</li>
<li>Stream B – Green Internships: Employers in the agricultural sector but not directly on farm could receive up to a maximum of $16,000 per intern to undertake environmental activities, services or research that will benefit the agriculture sector.</li>
</ul>

 <h3 id="a2.1">2.1 Duration</h3>
 
 <p>Each internship must be completed by the initiative end date of March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2017. The minimum duration is four months, but internships must be long enough to provide meaningful work experience to the employee.</p>
 
 <h3 id="a2.2">2.2 Eligible applicants</h3>
 
 <p>Eligible applicants must be capable of entering into legally binding agreements.</p>
 
 <h4>Eligible employers</h4>
 
 <p>Eligible employers are organizations who can offer projects that will give employees:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Environmentally beneficial, agricultural career-related work experiences in Canada; and</li>
 <li>skills acquisition through mentoring and coaching.</li>
</ul>

<p>These employers are typically farm operators (sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations) but may also be:</p>
<ul>
 <li>for-profit and not-for-profit organizations;</li>
 <li>provincial and municipal governments;</li>
 <li>associations;</li>
 <li>boards;</li>
 <li>councils; and</li>
 <li>universities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligible employees</h4>

<p>To qualify, you must:</p>
<ul>
 <li>be 30 years old or younger at the start of the project;</li>
 <li>have graduated from a university, college or CEGEP;</li>
 <li>not have participated in any other Youth Employment Strategy programs (that is, Career Focus);</li>
 <li>be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligible projects</h4>

 <p>Projects are intended to be part of the activities of a farming enterprise or an organization that would be engaged in farming activities.  Projects must support the implementation of an environmentally beneficial activity(ies) on the farm; they must be a minimum of four months and may last up to the initiative end date of March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2017.  The project must be long enough to give the employee significant experience that will position the individual for long-term employment.</p>
 <p>Applicants of the Green Farms Stream are required to describe the environmentally beneficial management activities that would be undertaken by the intern, how these activities will increase employability skills and describe the expected environmental benefits. Successful applicants will also be required to report at project end on the results of the project activities and the jobs created.</p>
 
 <h3 id="a2.3">2.3 Maximum funding amount</h3>
 <p>Each project will be eligible to receive up to $10,000 under the Green Farms Stream in matching funds (that is, 50:50 cost-share between the applicant and AAFC). </p>
 
 <h3 id="a2.4">2.4 Application intake</h3>
 <p>The initiative will be accepting applications on a continuous basis as long as funds remain available. Applications will be accepted starting at 10:00am EDT on April 25, 2016. </p>
 
 <h3 id="a2.5">2.5 Eligible activities</h3>
 <p>Eligible activities include those of an approved project which involve an environmentally beneficial management activity or supporting the implementation of a Beneficial Management Practice that will help improve the intern's employability in the agricultural field. </p>

<p>A Beneficial Management Practice is defined as any agricultural management practice(s) which:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ensure the long-term health and sustainability of land-related resources used for agricultural production;</li>
 <li>Positively impact the long-term economic and environmental viability of agricultural production; or</li>
 <li>Minimize negative impacts and risk to the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Province and Territory may be delivering a program to support the implementation of Beneficial Management Practices. Applicants may wish to consult their provincial/territorial agriculture ministry regarding typical practices that may meet the eligibility requirements of this initiative. However, applicants are cautioned that the proposed activities will be reviewed to determine the environmental benefits created by the project to ensure they meet the eligibility requirements of the initiative.</p>

<h3 id="a2.6">2.6 Eligible costs</h3>
 
 <p>Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiative funds may only be allocated for salaries and social benefits. The employer is responsible for paying the employee. </p>
 
 <h3 id="a2.7">2.7 Ineligible costs or limitations</h3>
 
 <p>The Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiatve only supports salaries and benefits for qualified interns.</p>
 
 <p>Because of the demand for internships, applicants may be limited to a maximum of two application approvals initially with additional approvals pending availability of funds and the need to strive for a national distribution of projects.</p>

 <h2 id="a4.0">4.0 Assessment and approval</h2>
 
 <h3 id="a4.1">4.1 Assessment criteria</h3>

<p>Successful Applicants who enter into a Contribution Agreement with AAFC will be referred to therein as Recipients. Recipients are required to enter into a Contribution Agreement that outlines the amount of funding AAFC will provide to the Recipient toward eligible costs, as well as the Recipient's responsibilities and obligations.</p>

 <h4 id="a4.2.1">4.2.1 Payments to Recipients</h4>
 
 <p>AAFC will make payments based on claims submitted for eligible costs incurred and paid by the Recipient in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement. Each claim must be supported by details of the costs being claimed and certified by an authorized official of the Recipient.</p>
 
 <p>For projects of less than eight months, AAFC may reimburse up to 100% of the contribution approved in the Contribution Agreement at the end of the internship, upon receipt of the final report, proof of salary payment to the candidate, and a completed Financial Claim Form.</p>
 
 <p>For projects of eight months or longer, AAFC may reimburse up to 50% of the contribution approved in the Contribution Agreement after the first half of the internship, only upon receipt of the completed Financial Claim Form and proof of salary payment to the candidate. The payment of the last 50% is made at the end of the internship, upon receipt of the final report, the Financial Claim Form and proof of salary payment to the candidate.</p>

 <h3 id="a5.1">5.1 Official languages</h3>
 <h4 id="a5.1.1">5.1.1 Language of service</h4>
 
 <p>Applicants and Recipients are encouraged to communicate with AAFC in the official language of their choice. AAFC reviews and assesses applications and project deliverables in both official languages.</p>
 
 <h4 id="a5.1.2">5.1.2 Language obligations of recipients</h4>

 <p>In all cases the Recipient must publicly acknowledge AAFC's support for the project and project-specific communications products.

<p>All projects receiving funding from AAFC must comply with the <cite>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</cite> (CEAA 2012).

If you do not know, indicate that this information is &quot;unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will consider whether your project requires an environmental determination under section&nbsp;67 of the CEAA 2012 and take the necessary steps if a determination is required and may inform you accordingly.</p>

<p>Provide details on any environmental risks in the &quot;Risk Assessment&quot; section in the Application Form, which includes confirming whether you have or will obtain federal, provincial, territorial or municipal authorizations and permits.
